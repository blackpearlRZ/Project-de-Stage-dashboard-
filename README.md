# Project Presentation
## Project Study
As part of my internship at Poste Maroc Hassan Rabat, I developed Dashboard Amana, a web application designed to manage packages and track Amana delivery services.

### Project Objectives
The main objective of the Dashboard Amana developed for Poste Maroc Hassan Rabat is to centralize and efficiently visualize Amana package data to enhance delivery tracking and operational management.

#### Key objectives include:

<strong>1.Facilitate real-time package tracking</strong>

Display shipment status (pending, in transit, delivered, etc.), payment status, and package details (recipient, tracking code, weight, CRBT, etc.).
Enable intuitive visualization through interactive charts and tables.

<strong>2.Improve logistics management and decision-making</strong>

Provide monthly statistics (total shipments, total CRBT) to analyze performance.
Filter data (by customer, date, status, etc.) for targeted tracking.

<strong>3.Reduce manual tasks and errors</strong>

Automate reports and package tracking to avoid repetitive data entry.
Ensure compliance with Poste Maroc's internal processes.

<strong>4.Enhance customer and internal experience</strong>

Offer customers full transparency on their shipment status.
Allow managers to quickly identify delays or anomalies.

<strong>5.Enhance customer and internal experience</strong>

Maintain a history of all operations for auditing or future tracking.
