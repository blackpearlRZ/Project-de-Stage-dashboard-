# Project Presentation
## Project Study
As part of my internship at Poste Maroc Hassan Rabat, I developed Dashboard Amana, a web application designed to manage packages and track Amana delivery services.

### Project Objectives
The main objective of the Dashboard Amana developed for Poste Maroc Hassan Rabat is to centralize and efficiently visualize Amana package data to enhance delivery tracking and operational management.

#### Key objectives include:

##### Facilitate real-time package tracking

Display shipment status (pending, in transit, delivered, etc.), payment status, and package details (recipient, tracking code, weight, CRBT, etc.).

Enable intuitive visualization through interactive charts and tables.

##### Improve logistics management and decision-making

Provide monthly statistics (total shipments, total CRBT) to analyze performance.

Filter data (by customer, date, status, etc.) for targeted tracking.

##### Reduce manual tasks and errors

Automate reports and package tracking to avoid repetitive data entry.

Ensure compliance with Poste Maroc's internal processes.

##### Enhance customer and internal experience

Offer customers full transparency on their shipment status.

Allow managers to quickly identify delays or anomalies.

##### Ensure data traceability and archiving

Maintain a history of all operations for auditing or future tracking.
